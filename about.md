# About

ioscodesnippet.com is founded by [Jamz Tang]. During his 3+ years iOS
experience he noticed there is just too much boilerplate code developers
have to write. Since early 2012 he decided to host a blog to collect
snippets and reusable components to hopefully also help others out
there, but he's lacking commitment to this blog due to his full-time
job.

2013 Sept is a big month for him. He decided to quit his job and become
a freelancer. He think its time to look back into revamping this site,
removing obsolete code and integrate Cocoapods to make using the
snippets much easier.

"Maybe someone would also like to contribute?", Tang thought. If you think
you like this idea, please [get in touch] with him :)
