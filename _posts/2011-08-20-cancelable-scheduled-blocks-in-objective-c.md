Sometimes you'd really want to perform a delayed action for your apps. We'll create a category on NSObject to provide a really handy usage.

The best thing with this snippet is your scheduled operations are cancelable, so you can choose to only perform your latest triggered operation (e.g. for your table view cells maybe?)

```objective-c
{% include submodules/NSObject-JTCancelableScheduledBlock/NSObject-JTCancelableScheduledBlock.h %}
```

```objective-c
{% include submodules/NSObject-JTCancelableScheduledBlock/NSObject-JTCancelableScheduledBlock.m %}
```

Usage:
 
```objective-c
[self performBlock:^(void) {
     NSLog(@"delayed operation!");
} afterDelay:2];
```  

Handy right?
